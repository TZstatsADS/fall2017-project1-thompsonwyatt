Term: Fall 2017

+ The Secret To Greatness: A Look Into Historians' Presidential Rankings
+ This project is conducted by Wyatt Thompson

In this project, I explore the texts of the inaugural speeches given by US presidents. 
We look at the meta features, like the differences between first and second term presidents, and we then move on to look at the word choice of presidents and the associated sentiments. We then pull in the C-SPAN historian ranking of presidents and see if we can try to get an understanding of what historians like to see!
